# The Ascent of Ouranos

2013

## Annotation

The Ascent of Ouranos is a larp depicting the voyage of five souls through time, through key events of human lives, from completely intimate moments to great, historical ones. The play is strictly divided into scenes and each of them has different events and characters appear. However, they are interconnected by the same player, representing a soul and a certain elementary human form which remains the same all the time.

The larp looks for answers to the question to know what impression the souls and their thoughts will make in completely different scenes; it induces dilemmas, and thanks to the diversity of characters it examines them from different points of view. We tried to prepare enough content offered to the players by the organizers, so that they are able to act out the scenes without their own input. The game aims at opening a discussion, though, so it is possible and even very welcome for the players to enlarge the characters and introduce new ideas and views of their own.

PREPARE
Normally it is not necessary for the players to prepare for the game. It is possible, though, to agree on an open game and make the list of scenes and character sheets public beforehand.
Before the game, the Guide (this is how we will call the person who presents and leads the game) should read this whole text (including the annotation, which gives him an overall idea of the game and makes him understand the basic principles of the game). Throughout the reading, he will also have to consult the character sheets so that he understands the instructions in the part “The Larp Runs“ and know what happens in each scene.
Know the Design
The annotation that gives an overview of the game as a whole is crucial for the understanding of the game. It says what the game all about is, introduces its principles and its goals. You can find a detailed explanation in the chapter “Preparation with Players“. The game uses a concept of characters and souls. Characters are represented by usual descriptions of individual persons; they are different for each scene and the player switches them throughout the game. By contrast, the soul represents a set of principles and motivations that remain for each player the same throughout the whole game, and they are reflected in each of the player’s characters. Both the character sheet for the individual scene and the soul sheet for the whole game will give the player an idea of what to do in the scene.
Place
We suggest you to use a room of approximately 13 x 22 ft (4 x 7 m) with two tables, six chairs and power supply. It should be possible to split it symbolically into two parts, for the Guide (the out-game world) and for players (the in-game world) – this boundary is then worked with in the game.
It is important for the players to feel comfortable and to be disturbed by as little outside effects as possible (items that do not belong to the game, but also noise, cold,...). This enables both better immersion into different environments (that change during the game), and better discussion (which represents an important feature of the game).
Classrooms with decorations, very large rooms, basements full of stuff are inappropriate; we recommend to use black box if possible.
Costumes
Costumes are not needed.
Props
A bowl and stones - They are used for different game mechanics; you should prepare about 20 stones (I mean a token, even though normally we really use small stones. It must be possible to throw them into the bowl and it must be clearly heard).
Loudspeakers and a laptop with the music prepared before the game. Music can be the same or inspired by the recommended playlist.
The sound of the bell is required to be played during some scenes. Prepare a sound on your laptop or get the real bell.
A phone (doesn't need to be functional) - a mobile phone or anything representing a landline can be used as the phone; it will be placed at the edge of the place for scene 3.
Optional Props
Scene 1: axe, items representing Middle-ages
Scene 2: cigars, Mojito, transistor radio playing period music
Scene 3: champagne glasses and some suitable non-alcoholic substitute for a toast
Scene 4: any cliché related to Rock fans (bandanna, bracers, eyeliners, some music instrument or item)
Scene 5: formal clothes or any futuristic looking accessories
Documents
Character sheets - contain two types of documents: soul sheets (players obtain them at the beginning of the game and they keep them throughout the entire game) and character sheets that players obtain before each individual scene. Soul sheets contains names of all characters. All papers that belong to one player are marked by the same letter of greek alphabet.
When you print the character sheets, make sure the name is printed on the front side, so that other players can see who plays what during the distribution of characters before the scene.
Some of the original names of characters and places might be difficult to pronounce or remember. This is why we sometimes suggested a more common set of names (always in brackets after the original name). However, the decision on which set of names to use is completely up to you.
List of scenes - instructions for individual scenes for the Guide (you do not need to print them, you can have them in your laptop); the Guide reads them before each scene.
Message from the government testing laboratory: Kamila Janková (Camilla Dahler) will get the message before the scene n. 3

Preparation with Players
The Guide should tell the information mentioned in this part to the players before the game.
Structure of the Game
The game is divided into 5 scenes (and a short epilogue). Each scene takes place in a different epoch, with different characters – the Guide distributes the character descriptions to the players before each scene. All characters have the same soul (that one player received before the game) and throughtout the scenes and characters the soul manifests itself.
Before each scene, the Guide also reads the introduction to the scene and distributes the characters. Once the players finish their reading, the Guide starts the scene by repeating the introduction. Each scene takes (roughly) 20 minutes and is terminated by the sound of bells. The break between the scenes serves to prepare mentally for the next scene and to read the character sheets; the players should not speak to each other during the break.
How to Play
At first glance, the scenes seem completely unrelated. Later it shows that all the characters represented by one player throughout the game share a certain form, set of values, a basic setting – or soul, if you like.
Also, each scene introduces an issue or a question for the characters (and, through them, the souls) to deal with, comment on, explain and defend their views.
The primary goal of the game is to trigger a discussion about the topics of the scenes. Players are invited to use their own arguments and views to enrich the characters. The secondary goal is to show how different is the impression the same soul makes in different contexts and situations. Before each scene, players compare the soul sheet (that they keep from the beginning of the game) to the character sheet (that they get for the individual scene) and may discuss their questions with the Guide. The players should always understand how are the specific opinions of the character based on the fundamental motivations of the soul, so that the character makes sense to them and they can defend and explain their thoughts in the scene.
However, if the player cannot think of any new topics for the discussion and does not feel like engaging in a complicated reasoning, no need to worry. Every scene also offers classical plots that can be acted out in the traditional way, and it will work as a plan B.
In any case, it is necessary to sort out and conclude the issue in each scene – it is not possible to compromise, postpone the decision or base it on other conditions. The players must only use the information they have in the game (they can only complete their information by means of the game mechanics, see below) and use them to conclude the scene.
Mechanics
The game is strongly based on the cooperation of the Guide and the players, for which it uses several mechanics.
Scene Ending
The conclusion of the scenes is mostly up to the players. Let’s suppose a player feels that all the important things have already been said, and they have a good idea how to end the scene. They place themselves at the edge of the scene, facing the others, and clearly says several sentences to terminate the scene with.
Imagine that your story is told in a novel or in a film. Do you have an idea of a perfect last line or final shot of the film? Then it is the right thing to terminate the scene with. Try to rehearse the final speech a bit, and if somebody else starts their final speech before you, it is better to let them finish. After all, imagine a bad guy uncovering his plan at the end of a movie, and half way through the hero interrupts him and starts contesting some detail. It would look rather lame.
If another player’s character has an important secret that has not yet been revealed, or an argument they wish to bring into the game, they can join and oppose the first player. This is how they let the first player know that they should return among the other players and let the second player introduce the new topic to the game.
On the contrary, if there is no crucial twist to the story, the other players let the concluding player finish their speech and they don’t react. When the player stops speaking, the Guide puts on the sound of ringing bells and the scene is over. In any case, opposing a player who has decided to conclude the scene should only be done exceptionally.
The other mechanics use stones – every player has two of them, the Guide three. It is good to distribute them at this point of the preparation.
Question
The other mechanics use stones – every player has two of them, the Guide three. It is good to distribute them at this point of the preparation.
The player enters the “out-game“ area, throws a stone into the bowl on the Guide’s desk and asks a question that is crucial for the scene or discussion.
The game is interrupted and the other players are looking. The Guide answers and his answer becomes a binding fact for all the characters – they either know it, are convinced about it or (if they for example had firmly believed the contrary) feel deep inside that they are wrong even though they are refusing to accept it.
An example of a typical question is: “Did she die because I was drinking and driving?” or “If we let the parliament vote on it tomorrow, is it going to pass?”
The answers can even be very indirectly related to the question. The Guide choses the answer so that it is, above all, interesting for the current situation in the game, secondly, so that it reduces a major imbalance among opinions in the game, and as a last resort, according to what they find true / corresponding to the facts of the game. The Guide has freedom to say anything suitable and he is creatively co-creating the game together with players. Typical answers can be such as: “Somebody has a way bigger share of blame than you” or “If the army learns this, quite possibly there won’t be any parliament tomorrow.”
The characters normally use the questions to support their reasoning; or the answer can influence the decision in the scene. The players shouldn’t ask technical questions or questions unimportant for the story. If they do so, the Guide tells them to keep their stone and to find the answer themselves.
Memory
Similarly as in the first case, the player throws a stone into the bowl and the game is paused. The player does not ask a question but chooses a situation that occurred in one of the previous scenes. He calls in the players who took part in the scene to re-play it briefly (a few sentences will do).
When the players resume the game, their characters will be strongly influenced by the feelings and mutual emotions of the replayed situation, even though the characters themselves cannot rationally explain why.
Giving out the Stone
Finally, the player (or the Guide) can give somebody the stone - or during the scene or during the break. However, he doesn’t lose it – he takes a new one from the bowl.
It is completely up to the player whether and why they give somebody his stone – the game intentionally doesn’t say that. (It is the players, not characters, who hand their stones over to each other. In other words, the fact that a player has received or handed over their stones should not influence the actions of the characters.)
The Guide may use the stones, for example, to appreciate somebody’s action or to add a stone to somebody who doesn’t have enough. However, the Guide shouldn’t give these examples away to the players and should let them find their own explanations instead. Otherwise the players can be too sure about the reasons why something is happening, they won’t have to think about it and look for new motivations to hand their stones over, which would be a pity.
Workshop
Since the souls cannot be disclosed explicitly at the beginning, it is up to the Guide to assign them to players.

The game aims at showing, among other things, how differently is the soul perceived by the person who plays it, and by the other players. This topic is also highlighted in the aftergame workshop that tries to hold a mirror to every player. The player can often perceive the action of their character as the only right and logical thing to do, and only thanks to the feedback from other players they start to realize that there were other points of view of their actions. To enable this, the others must describe their impressions of the fellow player’s soul in as much authentic and varied way as possible, without any prior bias. That is why the descriptions of the souls must not be made public before the game.

Make sure that the souls and characters fit the players who are going to represent them through the game. It does not mean that the soul should correspond to the views of the player (nor is it possible). However, it is important for the central topics of the soul not to be alien to them; the player should have an attitude (positive, or negative) towards them and should be able to establish an internal relation to them. This will be the foundation to build upon during the game. The workshop described below offers a way to distribute souls and characters to players:

The players and the Guide sit in a circle. The guide then says a particular word (see the list below) and the players close their eyes and give a thumb up or a thumb down sign, according to the feelings the word evokes in them (it does not have to be an overall assessment – on the contrary, it can be the player’s first association. The reasons are completely up to the player.) However, the players must make a decision; their answer cannot be neutral. Once everybody has decided, the Guide asks them to open their eyes (the thumbs stay so that everybody can see them). Then the guide asks one player giving a thumb up sign, and one giving a thumb down to describe what was the reason and motivation of their decision. This repeats several times.
The guide is to ask supplementary questions and to make the player elaborate their answer as much as possible. The answers serve the Guide to figure out what the players think about the individual topics and what soul would suit them. However, it is not a discussion! The Guide should by no means argue against the views of the players and they are to ensure that only the person who was asked is speaking at a time.
The choice of the appropriate words is completely up to the Guide (according to what are the topics they need know more about at the moment). The words can be related to the central topics of different scenes. The list we normally use can serve as inspiration:
Rome 4
Chance
Change
Buddhism
Competition
President
Computers
The ultimate truth
Decadence
See everything
Coincidence
Human
The first word, Rome, refers symbolically to the entire workshop mechanism – thumbs up or down, as in gladiator fights. It may be interesting to hint at it and see whether some of the players gets the hint, and explains it in their answer to the question why they have given the thumb up or thumb down sign (it may indicate how the players use information and symbolism, which may help to assign the characters).
Once the Guide has a good overview of the way the players think, they finish the workshop and distribute the soul cards. Obviously it is needed that Guide knows souls and characters very good so he can make decision of pairing players with souls after the workshop.
PLAY
Starting the Larp
The players read their souls and clarify any ambiguities and doubts (in secret) with the Guide.
The Larp Runs
Before every scene, the Guide prepares the character sheets on the table and the players take them, but they do not read them yet. The guide puts on the appropriate music for the scene and reads the introduction to the scene. After that, the players start reading their character sheets. When they finish, they put them sheets back on the table and as soon as everybody finishes reading, the guide re-reads the introduction (or summarizes it briefly) and turns the music down. In this moment the game starts.
The Guide influences the scene for example by its escalation (see below), using their own stones and answering the players’ questions. The Guide tries to keep the discussion in balance and to introduce new topics if necessary.
At the end of each scene, the Guide puts on the sound of ringing bells and delivers the epilogue to finish the scene. For example: “And that was the decision. Jack sacrificed himself and the real culprit was given a second chance. However, whether he seizes it or not, is not a part of this story. The role of the souls in this story is over and another story on a different place and in a different time awaits them, in the distant future.“
Besides that, every scene can have specific features:
Scene n. 1
A the beginning, only Matouš (Andrew) and Ludmila (Joanne) are inside the farm building, other players are let in the game by the Guide one after another, as the characters gather one by one. Guide may tell Matouš (Andrew) to reveal the information about the dead tax collector only after couple of minutes. Guide may escalate the scene by representing the farmer Partick who looks into the house through the window, saying: “Matouš (Andrew), the manorial bailiff is in the village, he goes from door to door looking for the tax collector, he’ll be here in a moment.”
At the end, the Guide may play the part of the bailiff: “Matouš (Andrew), the tax collector was last seen near your house. So you won’t mind if I search it, will you?” The characters either kill him, or they turn somebody in (this is how they in fact decide whether they start the uprising).
Scene n. 2
The scene can be escalated by special broadcast: the Latin American music in the radio fades away and is replaced by an urgent voice: “Young communists are taking to the streets in all major cities of the country and are expressing a clear opinion: they ask the president to dismiss the government and to call an early election. Repeat...“
The scene can also be escalated by the arrival of a secretary (played by the Guide) who says that the press is awaiting the president’s speech.
At the end of the scene, it is appropriate to place a lectern in the room and let the president deliver his speech where he announces his decision.
Scene n. 3
no music
Beforte the scene, Kamila (Camilla) is given the results of the measurement. A phone is placed at the edge of the scene for her to use to call the journalist (one of the possible endings of the scene).
Kamila (Camilla) and Karel (Charles) must be explained the accreditation process in the government testing laboratory.
Jarmila (Julie) is given an instruction to introduce the scene by a short speech.
Scene n. 4
Radek comes a little bit later.
Scene n. 5
Rezina Coleman is charged by the dean to deliver the decision of the commission. The questions are namely what to do with SV001 herself, whether she will be somehow restricted in the future, and what to do with Utrecht’s research (whether it can continue and under which conditions; also, whether he is allowed to build other prototypes). Rezina will get the instruction to moderate the discussion throughout the scene and then invite her colleagues to give their final opinions.
It is also necessary to explain Utrecht and SV001 the control commands and tell SV001 that she starts the scene in the stand-by mode. All instructions are very clearly explained in the character sheet of Utrecht.
At the beginning of the scene, SV001 sits on a chair placed on the line dividing the game area and the area for the Guide (between the in-game and the out-game world).
Instead of bells, High Hopes is recommended to be put on at the end of the scene and keeps playing during the epilogue. At the beginning of the High Hopes song there is a sound of a distant bell, which refers to the bells at the end of each scene, and at the same time marks the end of the game since it is different than the other bell sounds.
Ending the Larp
With the music still on, the Guide enters the scene and gives the epilogue:
„Just as people are born, live and die, souls and worlds are born, live and die. This world is dying. This world is coming to its end. But every end is a new beginning. And that is why we will go back to the imaginary beginning. Keep two stones (the Guide will hold out the dish and let the players give back their stones or get some more), make a circle and close your eyes.“
If SV001 didn’t survive the final scene, in this moment the Guide leads her out of the game area. It might perhaps mean that the “machine“ soul in the last scene was a “purer“ form than the others, and it was completely destroyed when it was erased.
„This world is coming to its end, but new worlds will come, and new souls and new people. And before the old world ends and its souls leave, they have one last decision to make. They must decide what the new humans will be like.
Hold out your empty hand. I will gradually tap each of you on the shoulder. In this moment, you open your eyes and give your stones to the other souls based on how you want these souls to be represented in the new human being.
Every time stones are distributed, the Guide reminds the players: “Hide the stones you have received“ (unless the players have already done that). Once all stones are distributed, the Guide continues: “Hold out your open hand with the stones you have received and look: this is what the new human will be like.“ The Guide waits a while for the players to see how the stones are distributed, and then they say: “And this is the end of the game.“
DISCUSSION
After the game, the Guide joins the circle of the players and leads the feedback activity. They ask each player individually a question to know how they perceived the other souls, whether they have recognized a unifying principle in them and, for example, what was their motivation for the distribution of the stones at the end. This is how the Guide lets the player comment on the souls of all the other players.
The guide may ask questions such as: “What was your impression of Monica’s characters? What about Peter and his roles? Did you see some unifying or repeating element in them?“ By mentioning the names of the players (not characters) and using words such as “play“, “represent“, “role“, the Guide helps the players separate the impressions of the game from the player’s real personality (which may be important, especially in the case of the evil characters.
The task of the Guide is to make the player elaborate on their answer by means of additional questions (just as in the pre-game workshop, this is not a discussion. The Guide makes sure the players do not react to each other).
Once everybody has assessed the others, the Guide starts the second feedback activity. This time, they ask each player to describe how they perceived their own soul and what themes were (in their interpretation) most important. Again, the Guide should help the player by asking additional questions.
Moreover, almost each player finds their own interpretation of the soul and highlights just some of the topics (or introduces new ones, which were not present in the soul originally). This is why the Guide must understand and be able to make the player explain how the player understood the motivations of the characters and how the player interpreted them so that they made sense to them.
Few words
First of all, I do not think that an author should explain their game. It receives its meaning by the performance of the game, by the experience of an individual who takes part in the game and by the manner the individual integrates their experience of it into their general experience. I think that the effort to describe an “objective meaning“, and to foist it on the player (or reader) has no place in a democratic society. I will respect the format of this book, though, so I will at least try to summarize it briefly.
This larp was made during the Larpworkshop - an event regularly orginzed in the Czech republic where teams of four to five members has to write a larp in 24 hour run. When we started to write the game, we only had a very loose common idea about it. We knew that we wanted to put different sets of values into different situations and to see how different would be the impressions they would give. We knew that one of us had seen the Cloud Atlas, whereas the others had no idea what it was (that still didn’t change, by the way). And we knew that we had 24 hours and the countdown had begun. And that was pretty much it.

I prefer to speak in singular from now on, because it was only me who made this decision (so I made it myself); the other authors don’t run the game anymore – they are too busy or they have decided that the game doesn’t make sense to them. With a bit of luck, you will be able to read their “Few Words” along with mine.

I only understood what the game was really like and what was important in it, when we were running it maybe for the fourth time. After that, I adjusted it and added mechanics that accented the important aspects more. Actually, I would rather say I decided then I understood, because it made sense to me within my individual experience. And I wish that anybody who organizes or plays this game goes through the similar development. That is, I wish that you has to decide yourself (just as my co-authors and I) what is the game all about, whether it makes sense, what aspects should be highlighted and how.
If somebody who enters the game convinced about the existence of a single universal good and evil, and the game makes them wonder why others have different notions of these concepts and what their motivation is, it will make me happy. But maybe you live in a society where diversity of values is such a natural concept that there is no need to talk about it. Or maybe morality is a very basic and obvious thing for you, and you see the effort to relativize things as a communist propaganda aimed at disrupting the order, in the absence of which the society would collapse.
Actually, you will make me most happy if you form your opinion yourself, based on your experience, after playing or reading the game and you don’t let me push my opinion upon you. Not just me, actually – not anyone else either. And not just after finishing the game, but ever.
