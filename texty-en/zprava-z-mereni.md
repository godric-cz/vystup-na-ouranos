# Report of the test results

Based on the performed measurements we find the material unfit for introducing into production. Full assessment of the individual samples and measurements carried out are stated within the reason below.

## Reason

The evaluated sample does not comply with the law-prescribed level of emissions of radon, which has been demonstrated by a complete measurement for a total of one sample delivered.

Measured property | Measured value | Deviation from the norm
------------------|----------------|------------------------
The level of nuclear decay per volume in the building caused by the emission of radon | 426 Bq/m³ _(±5%)_ | 213%

Measurement performed by: Ing. Ian Horak<br>
Supervisor of the measurement: Ing. Charles O'Reilly
