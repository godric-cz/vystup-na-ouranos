Other people are of crucial importance for you. You do not need to keep them for yourself and to love them in a selfish way; on the contrary, you wish to give yourself to others. Your life philosophy is that there is nothing greater than to sacrifice your life for the life of another person. You do not need others to repay your service or to reciprocate your attitude (even though you believe that this would lead to utopia), you content yourself with selfless helping. However, it doesnâ€™t mean that you let yourself be taken advantage of.
