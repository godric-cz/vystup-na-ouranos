# Robin of Dillmore

__Your name is Robin, you used to be a nobleman but you have lost all your property, you are 45 years old.__

You have been living in Worton since you refused to summon the Territorial Army on the king's order and to intervene against the revolting peasants about five years ago. That is why you lost your noble title, your estate was confiscated, you had a narrow escape from execution and you were sent here instead.

__Tonight:__ the farmer __Andrew__ appealed to you to come over â€“ you don't know why.

__Beginning of the scene:__ you are entering the room.

_Among other things, you have overheard Andrew talking about an uprising before. If it comes up, you must explain him how insane this idea is (none of the villagers have probably seen a real army before, they have no idea what would happen and how many people would die)._

_You are "on probation" and any minor offence in the village would probably result in death sentence for you. If worst came to worst, if there were no other way (after everything else failed), you would be able to offer your life to save somebody else (if it makes sense)._
