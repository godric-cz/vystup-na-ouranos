# Radek

Radek, the guitar player

Some of the band members sit in the clubroom after the rehearsal and you inform them that you have been approached by the manager of Rockwood, a very popular band, and have been offered to fill a vacant spot of a guitar player. You clearly see this as your life opportunity, so you are telling your band mates that you are thinking of accepting the offer.

However, if you do so, the existence of your band will be threatened. So you donâ€™t feel like leaving them either because they are your friends, you have created the band from scratch together.

- Lucas, the drummer
