Vera, the bass player

Radek’s best friend, maybe almost girlfriend. You know that if Radek leaves, it won’t help the band much. But you understand that Radek will follow his dream, you’ve dreamt about this together from the very beginning. And unfortunately, the dream came true only for one of you. (But maybe he won’t leave you completely?)

Other characters:

- Martina, the vocalist
- David, the bandleader
- Lucas, the drummer
- Radek, the guitar player
