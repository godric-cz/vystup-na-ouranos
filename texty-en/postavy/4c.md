# Vera

__Vera, the bass player__

__Radek’s__ best friend, maybe almost girlfriend. You know that if __Radek__ leaves, it won’t help the band much. But you understand that __Radek__ will follow his dream, you’ve dreamt about this together from the very beginning. And unfortunately, the dream came true only for one of you. (But maybe he won’t leave you completely?)
