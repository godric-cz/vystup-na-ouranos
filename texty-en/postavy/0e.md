The world is progressing towards a better future and people need to hope that they will live to see the good things. You try to give them this hope. The world exists for people to do big deeds in it, and you are the one who tries to do the greatest deeds. You are always able to see that the world consists not only in the gray daily routine; you can also see extraordinary things. You live in order to be able to discover them, by means of art, science or anything else.
