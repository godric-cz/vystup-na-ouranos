# Alísia Vez

Alísia Vez (31), president’s spokesperson and lover

Life is an opportunity to climb the social ladder for you, to break out of poverty you were born into. You believe that every person has the right to get what they earn. This is why you don’t loathe sleeping your way up sometimes. After all, how else could you become the president’s spokesperson? You like him, but he is rather a toy for you. You sometimes use his indecision to get your way.

You had to fight hard for your freedom and you won’t have it restricted on any account. People should make their decisions themselves, their life shouldn’t be determined by social conventions. You are not particularly interested in politics as such – you focus more on the power and money it brings.

You know Luís, the poet – you have discussed over a glass of wine a couple of times; you enjoy listening to his stories and his gushing over communism, but you are no supporter of communism yourself. (Why should one give up and share with others what one has achieved by one’s own work?)
