You always wish to fight for the freedom of any person. You hate imprisonment, slavery, restriction and oppression. You believe that the essence of being human is that one can do one’s will – and to carry out one’s humanity this way. It is not only important not to be restrained from doing one’s will – the possibility to carry out one’s freedom is of equal importance.
