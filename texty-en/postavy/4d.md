__Lucas, the drummer__

Your father, one of the municipal representatives, has supported your band a lot at the beginning – he helped with the organization, lent you the gym, a bus, helped you get the sound devices and so on. You think __Richard__ must not leave the band now. He would have been nobody without it, he wouldn’t know anybody. Your band would be nothing without your father’s help. It would be unfair if __Richard__ left. And it might be a good idea to seize the devices he has obtained.
