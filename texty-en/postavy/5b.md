Sebastian de Witt, PhD.

Social decision-making theory expert. You work at the University in Amsterdam and you study the decision-making based on other people. Rezina, whom you know from several conferences as an ambitious and very talented colleague, has contacted you to take part in an ethical commission with the task to examine the veracity of Utrechtâ€™s statements, to assess the impacts of his research and to suggest what to do with the results of his work.

You are trying hard to figure out what this technology will bring in the future. If there were robots smarter than people walking around, it would in fact mean an occurrence of a new species that humanity would have to share its living space with. The overpopulation already is a serious issue, and it would be a major sacrifice to make room for artificial forms of life.
