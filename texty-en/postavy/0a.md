It is important for you to carefully consider everything. You donâ€™t like making any hasty decisions about important things in your life. The worst evil for you is human stupidity. You want the world to work in a good and efficient manner. If you decide to adopt certain values, you carefully weigh one against another and consider risks and probabilities of the undesirable option. You understand that it is nonsense to waste your life for some ideal or other.
