__Samaael Spock, MPhil.__

Expert on formal systems and languages. If __Utrecht__ really managed to achieve what he intended, and he created a being comparable to human, it brings up fundamental ethical and legal questions. Should a machine like this have the same rights as humans, or should it be subordinate to humans and serve them, for example according to Asimovâ€™s laws of robotics (which say that robots cannot harm humans and must protect them)?
